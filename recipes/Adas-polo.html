        <h2>Iranian lentil and rice dish</h2>
        <p>Adas polow is one of the traditional Iranian dishes that I grew up with. 
            It's a great rice dish to prepare when you don't have a lot of time on 
            your hands yet you want something delicious. Rice with lentils is not 
            usually served in formal gatherings. However, you can make it for your family, 
            close relatives and friends. That's what I do. Adas polow can be served with 
            cooked ground beef. You can serve the cooked ground beef over the rice, on the 
            side of the rice or you can cook it together with rice and lentils in the same 
            pot.</p>

                    2 1/2 cups of water, bring to a boil on medium-high heat. Reduce heat to 
                    medium-low, add 1/4 teaspoon salt, cover and cook for about 20 minutes or 
                    until the lentils are soft and there is little liquid is left in the pot. 
                    Set aside.</li>
                    <li>Rinse rice with cool water, soak in 3-4 cups of water with 2 tablespoons 
                        of salt for a couple of hours. </li>
                    <li>Saute chopped onions in 2 tablespoons of oil on medium heat until the onions 
                        begin to soften, add turmeric, stir, Add the raisins, dates, a dash of cinnamon, 
                        saute lightly for a couple of minutes. Set aside</li>
                    <li>In a large non-stick pan, bring 4 cups of water to a rapid boil. </li>
                    <li>Drain rice and pour into the boiling water. Bring water to back a boil for 10 
                        minutes on medium-high heat. Test to see if the rice is ready. Rice should be firm 
                        in the center and soft on the outside. Drain and rinse with cool water.  </li>
                    <li>Wash the pot and return to heat. Add a couple of tablespoons of vegetable oil to the pot. 
                        With a large spatula, place a layer of rice into the pot, place a layer of cooked 
                        lentils, then another layer of rice, continue building it into a pyramid shape. 
                        Spread the liquid saffron over the rice. In order to release the steam make 2-3 
                        holes in the rice with the bottom of the spatula. </li>
                    <li>Cover and cook for 10 minutes on medium-high heat until rice is steaming, lower heat to 
                        medium-low and steam the rice for another 45-50 minutes.</li>
            </ol>
