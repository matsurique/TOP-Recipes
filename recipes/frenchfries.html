        <p>These air fryer French fries are just as crispy and crunchy as regular fries, but they use far less oil. With just 3 ingredients, they're easy and delicious.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 russet potatoes, sliced into 1/4-inch sticks</li>
                <li>Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling</li>
                <li>Sea salt</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the air fryer to 380Â°F.</li>
                <li>Drizzle the potatoes with olive oil, sprinkle with salt, and toss to coat.</li>
                <li>Place the potatoes in the air fryer basket in a single layer so that the potatoes are not touching each other. You will have to work in batches. Air fry for 12 to 15 minutes*, flipping halfway, or until crispy. If your fries are not crispy, air fry them a little longer.</li>
                <li>Once all batches are finished, toss them all back into the air fryer (no need to place in a single layer this time) for 1 to 2 minutes to warm and re-crisp any that got cold from the first few batches.</li>
                <li>Serve with desired seasonings and dips.</li>
            </ol>
