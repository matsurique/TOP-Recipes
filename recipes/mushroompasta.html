        <p>This vegetarian mushroom pasta is a personal favorite of mine for meatless Monday. The flavors are nicely balanced in the irresistible creamy sauce, and a touch of lemon juice brightens it up. It’s just decadent enough without being heavy.</p>
        <p>Simple ingredients are elevated in this easy mushroom pasta, so it’s special enough for company. Buttery, sautéed mushrooms, garlic, and white wine make this one of those low-effort family dinners that also impresses. And in just 30 minutes as well!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pasta</strong>-use what you’ve got, but I like a longer shape like fettuccine or linguine</li>
            <li><strong>Butter and olive oil</strong>- for sautéing</li>
            <li><strong>Cremini mushrooms </strong>– they’re sometimes labeled as baby bellas</li>
            <li><strong>Garlic</strong>– for more savory flavor</li>
            <li><strong>White wine</strong>use a dry white wine like sauvignon blanc or pinot grigio that you enjoy the taste of. Don’t use cooking wine!</li>
            <li><strong>Italian seasoning</strong>– my favorite blend of dried herbs. It comes all in one jar.</li>
            <li><strong>Lemon juice and Dijon mustard</strong>– for a burst of extra flavor to enhance the sauce</li>
            <li><strong>Flour</strong>– to thicken it</li>
            <li><strong>Heavy cream</strong>– it makes the sauce luxurious</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil a large, salted pot of water for the pasta and cook it al dente according to package directions. </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, add the butter and oil to a skillet over medium-high heat. </li>
            <li>Add the mushrooms and garlic to the pan and sauté for about 5 minutes, stirring often, until the mushrooms release most of their water and it’s cooked off.</li>
            <li>Take the mushrooms out of the pan and set aside.</li>
            <li>Add the wine, Italian seasoning, lemon juice, flour, and Dijon mustard to the pan. Stir until it becomes a smooth paste. </li>
            <li>Stir in the cream and let it simmer for a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the mushrooms back into the pan. Reduce the heat and cook for a few more minutes until the sauce has thickened up a bit. Season sauce with salt & pepper as needed.</li>
            <li>Drain the pasta and toss it with the sauce along with the parsley and parmesan if using. </li>
        </ol>
