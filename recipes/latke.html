    <h2>Jewish potato pancakes</h2>
    <p>These Jewish potato pancakes are so good that posting the recipe alone is a mitzvah (blessing) of the highest order. Bubbelah, you should always trust me with this stuff.</p>
    <h3 class="section title">Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul class="section title">
            <li>1 pound Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and cut into 2-inch chunks</li>
            <li>Sea salt</li>
            <li>2 pounds baking potatoes</li>
            <li>1 large onion, finely diced</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
            <li>1 cup matzo meal</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground white pepper</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil, for frying</li>
            <li>Applesauce, for serving</li>
            <li>Crème fraîche, for serving</li>
            <li>Smoked salmon, for serving</li>
            <li>Salmon roe, for serving</li>
            <li>Dill sprigs, for serving</li>
        </ul>
    <h3 class="section title">Steps:</h3>
        <ol class="section content">
            <li>In a medium saucepan, cover the Yukon Gold potatoes with cool water, season generously with salt, and bring to a boil. Cook the potatoes until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain well and immediately pass the potatoes through a ricer into a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Working quickly, peel and grate the baking potatoes on the large holes of a box grater into a medium bowl. Press with a clean kitchen towel to remove excess moisture. Add half of the grated potatoes to the riced potatoes.</li>
            <li>Transfer the remaining grated potatoes to the bowl of a food processor. Add the onion and pulse until the potatoes and onions are very finely chopped. Transfer to a fine-mesh sieve and press with the back of a spoon to extract as much liquid as possible. Add the potato-onion mixture to the large bowl. Stir in the eggs, matzo meal, white pepper, and 2 teaspoons of salt.</li>
            <li>In a large, heavy skillet, heat 1/4 inch of oil until shimmering. Working in 3 batches, spoon 1/4 cup of the potato mixture into the oil for each latke; press slightly to flatten. Fry over moderate heat, turning once, until the latkes are golden and crisp on both sides, about 7 minutes. Drain the latkes on a paper towel-lined baking sheet and sprinkle lightly with salt. Serve with applesauce, crème fraîche, smoked salmon, salmon roe, and dill.</li>
